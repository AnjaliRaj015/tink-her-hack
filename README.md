## whatsapp chat viewer with date filter and file format filter option
##### The exisiting system allows us to view whatsapp exported file in .txt format which is very difficult to read and sort messages or files from it
###### Whatsapp chat viewer helps us to view exported chat text files in whatsapp view. We used json to parse the text file and python flask app to deploy the application. Since we were able to parse the file in dynmaic loading format(input chat files do not get stored rather it dynamically loads into html file while executing) so we werent able to load the data in it to read and check the condition of dates and file format. So we tried parsing it by converting the .txt to csv file. 


### This is a repository containing the whatsapp chat text parsed file using json and how it can be viewed in whatsapp chat format
